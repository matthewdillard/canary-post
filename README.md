# Canary Post
A project resulting from the sticky notes I record ideas and thoughts down on, I crafted a font based on my handwriting on those sticky notes and buildt a widget to make your own notes online.

This repository serves as a version history for the font, as well as the source for the widget's code. 

You can make your own sticky notes [here](https://matthewdillard.github.io/canary-post/)
